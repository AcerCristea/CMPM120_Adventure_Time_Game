// Acer Cristea
// Guardians of Sunshine
// Approximately 40-50 hours
// I have physic systems, camera systems, timers, tilemaps, a state machine, custom font, custom animations, input handling...
// The game has a really cool combo move to beat the frog. Make sure after jumping over the platform you walk until the frog's invisible barrier blocks you
// Only then can you start your combo. Otherwise I have a cool state machine with a bomb attack and create seperate physic hitboxes for them
// I used the examples given in class to help for the FSM and used the Keys which I credited in that scene's file
// Hope you enjoy!
